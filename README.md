# portfolio-carousel-detailed
Custom Post type (Portfolio) items will be displayed as carousel and on clicking system will display the detailed view

This code snippit will perform following actions:

1. Display Post Type (You can change the parameter to get yours) Items in carousel which is drag and drop.
2. Clicking on the Title will load the details of the clicked item.

It was developed to entertain the Total Premium Theme, if you want to display the plain text then you can remove the do_shortcode function from the content.
Disclaimer:
I have used Open Source Libraries to achieve the Carousel View. 

Thanks to the creators of Swiper Carousel
